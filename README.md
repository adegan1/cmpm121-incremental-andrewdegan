# CMPM 121 D1 Project

Student: Andrew Degan (1930024)
Class: CMPM 121
Quarter: Fall 2025

I created an incremental game titled "Frog Frenzy" in which the player clicks a frog in order to generate croaks. They use these croaks to buy upgrades that automatically produce more and more croaks for the player.

Change 1: Updated the UI to be more clean and modular.
Change inspired by student KupoDupo's incremental game: <https://github.com/KupoDupo/CMPM-121-D1-Incremental-Game>
Most of my changes take place solely in the style.css script, however I also made several changes to the formatting in main.ts (lines 93-155).

Change 2: TBD
