# CMPM 121 D1 Project

Quarter: Fall 2025

I created an incremental game titled "Frog Frenzy" in which the player clicks a frog in order to generate croaks. They use these croaks to buy upgrades that automatically produce more and more croaks for the player.

Change 1: Updated the UI to be more clean and modular.
Change inspired by student KupoDupo's incremental game: <https://github.com/KupoDupo/CMPM-121-D1-Incremental-Game>
Most of my changes take place solely in the style.css script, however I also made several changes to the formatting in main.ts (lines 93-155).

Change 2: Added button click and hover effects.
Change inspired by student Mrpoopers' incremental game: <https://github.com/mrpoopers/D1rich>
A few changes take place in the style.css script, such as the new mainbutton:hover/upgradebutton:hover styles and the mainbutton.clicked/upgradebutton.clicked classes. In main.ts, a few lines of code were added to trigger those animations when clicked. I also added floating hearts that appear above the main button when it is clicked.
